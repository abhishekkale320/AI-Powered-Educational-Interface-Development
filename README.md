# AI-Powered Educational Interface Development
## Project Report
1. Introduction and Objectives
## Introduction: 
The project aims to develop an educational support system using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
Generation) pipeline and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models. This system intends to enhance the
quality of responses to educational queries and provide an interactive platform for users.
## Objectives:
• Implement a robust RAG pipeline for document retrieval and augmentation.
• Utilize GPT models for generating educational responses.
• Create a seamless interaction platform for users seeking educational support.
2. System Architecture and Components
## System Architecture:
The system architecture comprises two main components - the RAG pipeline and GPT
models. User queries initiate the flow of data, which is processed either through the RAG pipeline or GPT
models to generate educational responses.
## Components:
1. RAG Pipeline:
• Retrieval: ElasticSearch is used for efficient document retrieval based on user queries.
• Augmentation: A T5 model augments retrieved documents to enhance response quality.
2. GPT Models:
• Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 is employed for generating responses to user queries.
3. Implemented Algorithms and Models
## RAG Pipeline:
• Retrieval Algorithm: ElasticSearch's TF-IDF algorithm for efficient document retrieval.
• Augmentation Algorithm: T5 model using transfer learning for document augmentation.
## GPT Models:
• GPT-3.5: Pre-trained and fine-tuned for educational response generation.
4. Database Schema and Storage Strategy
## Database Schema:
• User Queries Table: Columns - query_id, user_id, query_text, timestamp.
• Retrieved Documents Table: Columns - doc_id, query_id, doc_text, timestamp.
• Generated Responses Table: Columns - response_id, query_id, response_text, timestamp.
## Storage Strategy: 
Data is stored relationally to enable quick retrieval. Indexing is applied on frequently queried fields for optimized performance.
5 . Evaluation Metrics and Comparison Results 
## Evaluation Metrics:
• Precision, Recall, F1 Score.
## Comparison Results:

# AI-Powered Educational Interface
1. System Architecture
1.1 Chatbot Interface (Student Interface)
The chatbot interface leverages the MISREL instruct 7D model from Hugging Face. It serves as the backbone for
providing responses to student queries. The interface is built using Gradio, allowing for a seamless and
interactive conversation. User inputs are processed through the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model,
and the responses are generated for educational support.
1.2 School Interface
The school interface provides a secure platform for schools to upload educational materials. It includes
functionalities for uploading PDFs and videos. The uploaded materials undergo processing before being
converted into embeddings for efficient storage and retrieval.
1.3 Processing and Embedding Pipeline
## PDF Processing
1. Text Extraction:
• Utilized a PDF parsing library to extract text content from uploaded PDFs.
• Implemented techniques for handling various document structures and layouts.
2. Information Extraction:
• Applied natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information from the extracted text.
• Identified key concepts, topics, and contextual information.
## Video Processing
1. Video Analysis:
• Utilized video analysis libraries for extracting meaningful insights from educational videos.
• Techniques include speech-to-text conversion, object detection, and sentiment analysis.
## Embedding Conversion
1. Embedding Generation:
• Converted processed information from both PDFs and videos into embeddings.
• Used advanced embedding techniques, such as sentence embeddings or video embeddings, based on the
nature of the content.
1.4 Database and Storage
## MongoDB Schema
Designed a MongoDB schema to manage metadata and information related to educational materials and user
interactions.
1. Collections:
• Students: Stores information about student interactions and queries.
• Schools: Manages data related to schools, including uploaded materials.
• Embeddings: Stores embeddings along with metadata for quick retrieval.
## Embedding Storage (FIAS)
1. Vector Database:
• Utilized FIAS as the vector database for storing embeddings efficiently.
• FIAS provides fast and scalable storage, essential for handling a large volume of educational materials.
2. Integration of Gradio for the Frontend
The Gradio library was integrated to create user-friendly interfaces for both students and schools.
1. Chat Interface (Student):
• Implemented a text input interface where students can type questions or seek explanations.
• Gradio handles the communication with the MISREL instruct 7D model and displays the generated
responses.
3. School Interface:
• Developed an intuitive interface allowing schools to upload PDFs and videos.
• Gradio facilitates the interaction with the processing pipeline for material conversion.
4. Conclusion
The detailed documentation provides insights into the AI-powered educational interface's architecture,
processing pipeline, and integration components. The chosen technical stack, including the MISREL instruct 7D
model, Gradio, MongoDB, and FIAS, was selected for their capabilities in handling natural language
understanding, user interfaces, data management, and efficient embedding storage. The processing pipeline for
PDFs and videos demonstrates the systematic approach to extracting information and converting it into
embeddings. The MongoDB schema and FIAS storage ensure organized data management, while the Gradio
frontend enhances user interaction. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the
intricacies of the system.
